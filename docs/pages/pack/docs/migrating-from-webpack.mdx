# Migrating from Webpack to Turbopack

<Callout type="info">
  Turbopack now implements basic Webpack loader support and configuration familiar to Webpack users
</Callout>

We're planning Turbopack as the successor to Webpack. In the future, we plan to give Turbopack all the tools needed to support your Webpack app.

Currently, Turbopack supports a subset of Webpack's loader API and offers similar configuration aliasing module resolution. Note that using Webpack-based Next.js plugins as-is from `next.config.js` is **not yet possible**.

## Webpack loaders

Firstly, Turbopack for Next.js does not require loaders nor loader configuration for built-in functionality, just as they aren't required for Next.js. There's no need for `css-loader`, `postcss-loader`, or `babel-loader` if you're just using `@babel/preset-env`.

If you need loader support beyond what's built in, some Webpack loaders, including [`@mdx-js/loader`](https://mdxjs.com/packages/loader/) already work with Turbopack! There are currently some limitations:

- At the moment, only a core subset of the Webpack loader API is implemented. This is enough for some popular loaders, and we'll expand our support for this API in the future.
- Options passed to Webpack loaders must be plain JavaScript primitives, objects, and arrays. For example, it's not possible to pass `require()`d plugin modules as option values.

At the moment, configuring Webpack loaders is possible for Next.js apps through an experimental option in `next.config.js`. `turbopackLoaders` can be set to a mapping of file extensions to a list of package names or `{loader, options}` pairs:

**next.config.js:**

```js
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  experimental: {
    turbopackLoaders: {
      ".md": [{
        loader: "@mdx-js/loader",
        options: {
          format: "md"
        }
      }],
      ".foo": "my-foo-loader"
    }
  }
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

## Resolve aliases

Turbopack can be configured to modify module resolution through aliases, similar to Webpack's [`resolve.alias`](https://Webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias) configuration:

**next.config.js**

```js
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  experimental: {
    resolveAlias: {
      foo: "bar",
      baz: { browser: "baz/browser" },
    },
  }
}

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

The above aliases imports of the `foo` package to the `bar` package.

Turbopack also supports conditional aliasing through this field, similar to Node.js's [conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#conditional-exports). At the moment only the `browser` condition is supported. In the case above, imports of the `baz` module will be aliased to `baz/browser` when Turbopack targets browser environments.

## FAQ

### Which loaders are currently supported?

The following loaders have been tested to work with Turbopack's Webpack loader implementation:

- [`@mdx-js/loader`](https://mdxjs.com/packages/loader/) â€” note that plugin modules passed to `rehypePlugins` and `remarkPlugins` are not currently supported.
- [`raw-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-loader)

### Will it be compatible with Webpack's API?

Webpack has a huge API. It's extremely flexible and extensible, which is a big reason why it's so popular.

We're planning on making Turbopack very flexible and extensible, but we're **not planning 1:1 compatibility with Webpack**. This lets us make choices which improve on Webpack's API, and lets us optimize for speed and efficiency.

### Will we be able to use Webpack plugins?

Webpack plugins are a crucial part of Webpack's ecosystem. They let you customize your toolchain, giving you low-level tools to maximize your productivity.

Unlike loaders, Webpack plugins can be tightly integrated with Webpack's internals.

Since we're not offering 1:1 API compatibility for plugins, most won't work out of the box with Turbopack. However, we're working on porting several of the most popular Webpack plugins to Turbopack.
